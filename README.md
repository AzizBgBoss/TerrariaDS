# TerrariaDS
A terraria remake (not port) for the Nintendo DS made by AzizBgBoss.

This project is a work in progress and is not affiliated with the original Terraria game. It aims to replicate the core mechanics and gameplay of Terraria on the Nintendo DS.
It aims at least to somewhat replicate the 3DS version of Terraria, but with some features from the PC version, and some sacrifices to fit the DS hardware limitations.

I'm very open to contributions and suggestions, so if you want to help, feel free to open a pull request or an issue.

- Initial commit with basic project structure.
